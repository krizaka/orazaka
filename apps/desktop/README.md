# Sovkora Desktop

A [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) app (Rust + a web UI built with `@krizaka/ui` and `@krizaka/orazaka-design-system`,
Sovkora orange, dark/light, English/French) for macOS on Apple Silicon. v0.1 is a **test build**: it lets you run
Sovkora on your Mac, or connect to a hosted one, and give Sovkora **access to the folders you choose — and only those**.

> Delivery context: [`docs/DELIVERY.md`](../../docs/DELIVERY.md) — Sovkora Desktop is the installer and control panel of
> *Sovkora for Mac*. It never re-implements an operation: it runs the `orazaka` CLI as a sidecar.

## What it does (v0.1)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Control panel** | Status of the local stack (`orazaka status --json`), **Start** / **Stop**, **Run doctor**, logs (live output + `orazaka logs --service …`), CLI and app version, **Open workspace** (the web UI in an app window). |
| **Connect mode** | Point the app at a hosted Sovkora (default `https://dev.orazaka.com`, https only) and sign in **on the Sovkora page itself** — the app never sees or stores a password. |
| **File access** | Choose folders with the native picker; list and preview their files (text, images, PDF); **drag & drop** files into the workspace page or onto the panel; **watch a folder** for new files; **revoke** any folder or all of them. |
| **Menu bar** | An icon showing the stack's state (outline = stopped, filled = running/partial), with Open panel · Open workspace · Start · Stop · Quit. Closing the window keeps the app in the menu bar. |
| **Automations** | Scheduled work on a shared folder with a model served on this Mac — v0.2: *Summarise new PDFs every morning* (a note next to each new PDF). The filesystem MCP server is limited to that folder, every write waits for your approval (or a permission you gave: *always for this folder*), dry-run, **Stop all agents**, budgets, run history with a step-by-step trace, a hash-chained audit log. See [docs/AUTOMATION.md](../../docs/AUTOMATION.md) and ADR-079. Needs Node.js 22+ (the MCP server) and a local model (Ollama: `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b`). |
| **Auto-start** | "Start Sovkora when I log in" (macOS login item) — **off by default**, and it only opens the menu-bar app; nothing is started unless you ask. |

## Least privilege — how access is bounded

1. **No filesystem permission in the web layer.** The control panel's capability (`src-tauri/capabilities/main.json`) is
   `core:default` only: no `fs`, no `shell`, no `opener` plugin. The hosted workspace window has **no capability at all**
   (no IPC): the Sovkora page cannot call the app.
2. **Folder scope** ([`krizaka-tauri-kit`](https://github.com/krizaka/krizaka-tauri-kit) `scope`, shared by every Krizaka Mac app). The app can read a path only if its *canonical* form lies inside a
   folder you granted with the picker. `..` and symlinks that leave a folder are refused; grants are persisted
   (`~/Library/Application Support/com.krizaka.orazaka.desktop/scope.json`), shown in the **Files** tab and revocable
   (revoking also stops the folder watch). Your home folder itself, `/`, `/Users`, `/Volumes`, system folders and
   `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/Library`, … can **never** be granted.
3. **Drops** on the panel are one-file, this-session-only permissions; a dropped **folder** is shared only if you
   confirm. Drops on the workspace page are the browser's own (the page receives the file you drag, nothing else).
4. **Sidecar allow-list** (`src-tauri/src/sidecar.rs`). The UI cannot run a shell or an arbitrary program, nor pass free-form
   arguments: it names one of `version · status · start [dev|full] · stop · doctor · logs [service] [tail]`, and Rust turns
   it into a fixed argument vector (`stop` is always `stop -y`, never `--purge`). Everything else is refused before a process
   exists.
5. **Navigation guard.** The workspace window can only stay on the configured origin; other links open in your browser.
6. **Automations** (`src-tauri/src/automation/`). Tools are MCP servers pinned in `mcp-catalogue.json`, each tool with a
   declared effect: `read` stays inside the automation's folder, `write` waits for an approval or a grant, an undeclared
   tool is `exec` and refused — no shell, ever. The model only writes text (a fixed plan), so a document cannot steer a
   run. A revoked folder revokes the automation's grants.
7. **Hardened runtime** is on, with an explicit `entitlements.plist` that opts out of nothing (no JIT, no unsigned
   memory, no library-validation bypass). Notarization needs only the Developer ID (below).

## Requirements

macOS 14+, Apple Silicon. **Node.js 22+** on the Mac (`brew install node`): v0.1 bundles the orazaka CLI
(`@krizaka/orazaka-cli`, pinned in `package.json` → `orazakaCli`) but not a Node runtime. For the local stack: Docker
(OrbStack/Colima/Docker Desktop) and the Sovkora workspace folder — see Settings.

## Open the unsigned build

The `.dmg` is **not signed or notarized yet** (the Apple Developer ID is pending), so Gatekeeper blocks a plain
double-click. Drag **Sovkora** to *Applications*, then **right-click the app → Open → Open** (once). If macOS still
refuses ("damaged"), run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Sovkora.app`.

## Add signing and notarization (when the Developer ID exists)

Nothing in the code changes. Add these repository secrets; `.github/workflows/desktop.yml` already passes them to
`pnpm tauri build`, which signs the app and the sidecar with the hardened runtime and notarizes + staples the `.dmg`:
`APPLE_CERTIFICATE` (base64 of the *Developer ID Application* `.p12`), `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`,
`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` (`Developer ID Application: Krizaka (TEAMID)`), `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD` (app-specific
password), `APPLE_TEAM_ID`. Then drop "unsigned" from the release notes.

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm sidecar        # bundles the orazaka CLI into src-tauri/resources/cli (not committed)
pnpm tauri dev      # the app, with hot reload
pnpm check          # typecheck + UI tests (vitest) + Rust tests (cargo test)
pnpm build:app      # the .dmg: src-tauri/target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/bundle/dmg/
```

Rust tests cover the scope (grant, revoke, `..`/symlink escapes, forbidden folders, persistence), the sidecar
allow-list, the settings and navigation guard, and file listing/preview. UI tests cover the panels, the allow-listed
calls, the catalogues (en/fr parity) and the helpers.

## Release

Tag `desktop-vX.Y.Z[-suffix]` (it must equal `version` in `package.json` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`): the
`Desktop` workflow builds the `.dmg` on a macOS runner and attaches it, with its SHA-256, to the GitHub Release
(a pre-release when the tag has a suffix such as `-dev`).

## Code (ADR-093, slice 1)

The **Code** tab grants a git repository (through the folder scope) and gives the agent its read tools (`read_file`, `list_dir`, `search_text`, `outline`) and a review screen for proposed diffs. Gitignored files, `.git/` and secret patterns are invisible to every read, known token shapes are redacted, a diff is a pending object approved per hunk and applied exactly against its base hash, and `refs/orazaka/snapshots/<run-id>` makes undo one click. Code: `src-tauri/src/code/`.

### Checks (slice 2)

The one narrow `exec` (it amends ADR-079 §4). A **check** is `{ name, argv[], cwd, timeoutSecs, network }`. The repository may suggest checks (`package.json` scripts, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, `.orazaka/checks.json`); only a check the user confirmed in the app, once per repository and device, can run. The confirmation is a listed, revocable, audited grant (`code-checks.json`, audit events `code.check.*`), and the agent asks for a check **by name**. A run uses argv with no shell, an environment of `PATH`, `HOME`, `LANG`, a private `TMPDIR` and what the check declares (never a credential), and a Seatbelt profile (`sandbox-exec`): writes only under the repository, the run's temp folder and the toolchain caches, never `.git/hooks` or `.git/config`, no network unless the confirmed check declares it. Without `sandbox-exec` nothing runs. A timeout kills the process group; output is capped and redacted; the audit keeps the exit code, duration, `timed_out` and the hash of argv. After an applied « changes what runs » hunk (recomputed on the Mac, not read from the page), the next run asks again even with a grant. Code: `src-tauri/src/code/checks.rs`.
