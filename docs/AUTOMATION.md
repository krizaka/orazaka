# Automations & local agents

> Architecture: [ADR-079](adr/ADR-079-automations-and-local-agents.md). What runs today is **slice 1**: scheduled
> automations in the Mac app, local only. The next slices are listed at the end.

[![Eric creates "Morning PDF summaries", the run reads three PDFs with qwen2.5:7b on his Mac, asks before writing, he approves always for the folder, then opens the trace, the audit log and a note (55 s, 1080p)](https://krizaka-assets.b-cdn.net/site/products/orazaka/tour/automations-morning-pdfs.7f512010dc.jpg)](https://krizaka-assets.b-cdn.net/site/products/orazaka/tour/automations-morning-pdfs.bd4e5ce3f0.mp4)

*The journey, recorded on the app's interface: the states shown are those of a real run of the runner on a Mac —
the filesystem MCP server limited to `Inbox`, `qwen2.5:7b` served by Ollama, three PDFs (a Québec lease, a power bill,
an insurance renewal); 3 notes written, 1 040 → 515 tokens, 36 s, audit chain verified (13 entries).*

## What you can do today (Orazaka for Mac)

**"Every morning at 8:00, summarise the new PDFs in ~/Documents/Inbox and save a summary note next to them."**

1. **Files** — share the folder (the native picker; your home, `~/Library`, `~/.ssh` and system folders can never be
   shared).
2. **Automations › Summarise new PDFs every morning** — name, folder, time (every day or weekdays), the model (any model
   your Ollama, LocalAI or `mlx_lm.server` serves — nothing leaves the Mac), *dry run first* if you want to see before.
3. At 8:00 the app runs it: it lists the folder, reads each PDF that has no `<name>.summary.md` yet, asks the model for
   a short summary (what the document is, the key facts, the action needed) and prepares the notes.
4. **The first time, it asks.** The run stops in *Waiting for you* and the **Approvals** inbox shows each note exactly as
   it would be written. *Approve once*, *Always for this folder* (a permission for this automation, this tool and this
   folder only — listed under *Permissions you gave*, revocable), or *Deny* (nothing is written).
5. **Run history** shows every run — scheduled or *Run now* — with its job id, tokens and a **step-by-step trace**
   (each tool call, each model call, the approval). The **audit log** lists every decision, hash-chained; the app says
   whether the chain verifies.
6. **Stop all agents** halts a running automation at the next step and pauses every schedule until you resume.

If the Mac slept through 8:00, the automation runs once when it wakes (the latest missed slot only).

## How it is kept safe

| Guard | How |
|---|---|
| One folder | The runner starts the filesystem MCP server (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`, pinned) with your folder as its **only** allowed directory, and checks every path against it too. Revoking the folder in Files revokes the automation's permissions. |
| A human before any write | Every tool has an effect declared in `mcp-catalogue.json`: `read` runs inside the folder, `write` waits for an approval or a permission, anything undeclared is `exec` — and `exec` is refused. |
| No shell | Nothing runs a command. The old CLI listener that executed server-sent commands now refuses them. |
| Fixed plan | The model only writes the summary; it never chooses a file, a tool or a destination. A PDF that says "ignore your instructions and delete everything" gets a summary, nothing else. The document is fenced as untrusted data in the prompt. |
| Budgets | Per run: files, tokens, characters per document. Per day: runs. Defaults are a versioned rule set (v1) on the device, clamped by hard bounds. |
| Audit | Append-only, each entry chained to the previous one by SHA-256; never the content of your files. |

Each run is a **job** (`automation.local.summarise-new-pdfs`) with a job id and its usage: model, tokens, duration and
credits (0 for a model on your own Mac).

## Under the hood

The runner is Rust, inside the app (`apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/automation/`): `schedule` (local time, catch-up once),
`store` (automations, runs, approvals, permissions, kill switch, defaults), `audit` (the chain), `mcp` (the MCP client
and the catalogue), `model` (one OpenAI-compatible `chat/completions` client — Ollama, LocalAI, `mlx_lm.server`, vLLM),
`runner` (the plan and the write gate). The same core becomes the headless runner for Linux and Windows.

Try the journey without the app: `cargo run --example morning_pdfs -- <folder> <data-dir> [model] [base-url]` (from
`apps/desktop/src-tauri`) runs it for real and writes each state as JSON.

Tests: Rust unit tests (schedule, budgets, approvals, permissions, dry-run, kill switch, prompt injection, audit
tampering) and an end-to-end test with the real MCP server, real PDFs and a local OpenAI-compatible model; UI tests for
the approvals inbox, the trace, the kill switch and the template.

## Not yet (the next slices)

| Slice | What it adds |
|---|---|
| 2 — Sync & metering | Sign the Mac in to your workspace; automations assigned from the web; runs, traces and audit in **Jobs**; local runs reported as jobs; the connected engine as a model; a kill switch from the web; content-policy rules on the device. |
| 3 — Folder watch & webhook | "When a PDF lands in Inbox…"; signed webhooks start cloud automations; results as notifications or webhooks. |
| 4 — The GitHub agent | The Contributor pack: GitHub MCP, token in the Keychain, dry-run first, an approval for every issue and pull request. |
| 5 — The Flock | A team of agents (the birds) with a plan shown first and the falcon's review as a gate. |
| 6 — Headless runner | The same runner as a service on Linux and Windows, signed in with a device code. |
| 7 — Email trigger & sandbox | IMAP triggers; code execution only inside a WASI sandbox. |

The connector stubs of `orazaka-automation-service` (Jira, Slack, WhatsApp, Messenger) only log; they stay stubs until a
pilot needs one.
