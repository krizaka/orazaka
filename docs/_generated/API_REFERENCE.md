# API Reference


**Access** is read from each service's `SecurityConfig`, most-specific matcher first — the same
order Spring Security applies. `SERVICE` is the machine-to-machine authority required on
`/internal/v1/**` (ADR-035); `public` means no credential at all, and **⚠ no rule** means
no matcher covers the path — the service has no security on it whatsoever.
