# CLI Reference

The `orazaka` CLI is the single orchestrator of the platform: it clones and configures the
workspace, starts the infrastructure, runs the whole stack, tests it, builds these docs and
installs packs. No shell script to remember — one command per intent.

## Quick start

Requirements: git, JDK 21, Node.js >=22, Docker (Python 3.11+ for the media worker).

```bash
npx orazaka install   # no workspace here? clones the platform into ./orazaka, then configures it
cd orazaka && ./mvnw install && (cd orazaka-apps/ui && npm install)
npx orazaka start     # Docker infrastructure (PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis, RabbitMQ)
npx orazaka dev       # the whole stack: services, web, admin, mobile
```

```cli-replay
npx orazaka install --yes
npx orazaka start
npx orazaka dev
```

`orazaka` on npm is the short name of the canonical package `@krizaka/orazaka-cli` — both run the same CLI:

```bash
npx @krizaka/orazaka-cli install      # the same as npx orazaka install
npm install -g @krizaka/orazaka-cli   # then: orazaka <command>
```

`install --check-only` only reports what is missing. `start`, `dev`, `test` and `docs` run inside
a workspace and say how to get one when there is none.

## What happens

What each command of the quick start does, in order — the phases it announces, the processes it launches:

```cli-journey
orazaka install — Setup wizard — verify tools, install dependencies, and configure deployment topology
  1. Tool Verification
  2. Install Missing Tools via Homebrew
  · Workspace (no Orazaka workspace here)
  3. Media Worker Python Environment
  4. Deployment Topology Configuration
orazaka start — Start Orazaka infrastructure — dev mode (Docker middleware + AI engines) or full mode (also Router + UI)
  1. Docker Services (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ)
  2. AI Engine (Ollama)
  3. Image Generation (LocalAI)
  3b. Image Generation (stable-diffusion.cpp)
  4. Media Generation Worker
  5a. Starting Router (Spring Boot) (--mode full)
  5b. Starting Next.js UI (--mode full)
orazaka dev — Launch the full Orazaka application stack in parallel (9 services + Web, Mobile)
  EDGE :8088
  ROUTER :8080
  IDENTITY :8083
  AUTOMATION :8082
  KNOWLEDGE :8084
  JOB :8090
  BILLING :8095
  STUDIO :8096
  NOTIFICATIONS :8097
  WEB-CLIENT :3000
  MOBILE :8081
  worker.yaml (Python workers, no HTTP port)
```

## Local dev workflow

The dev loop has two layers — start them in order:

1. **Infrastructure** — `orazaka start --mode dev` brings up the Docker middleware
   (PostgreSQL+pgvector, Redis, RabbitMQ) and the native AI engines (Ollama, LocalAI,
   video worker). Inference runs natively on macOS Metal — never in Docker.
2. **Applications** — `orazaka dev` spawns the services (edge, conversation router, identity,
   automation, knowledge, job, billing, studio, notifications), the Web client, the Web admin
   and the Expo mobile server in parallel. Prefer to debug the conversation router in your IDE?
   Run `ConversationServiceApplication` there and start the rest with `orazaka dev --skip-router`.

`orazaka start --mode full` additionally runs the router and the UI for a
hands-off boot. Tear everything down with `orazaka stop`. On a local stack,
`orazaka demo seed` creates the demo persona with its plan, packs and Studios.

> ℹ️ `start` manages *infrastructure*; `dev` manages *application processes*. They are
> complementary, not alternatives.
