# Measured runs
What the video and image models Orazaka routes to really did, measured on **2026-10-17**: each figure below is read from the **run records** of the platform (start and finish of every Studio run, its size and seed, its outcome) and from the engine's own log — none is typed by hand. Every number is for **this setup** and is measured again when the setup changes (a new model, engine version, provider or machine).

## Setup

| Part | What |
| --- | --- |
| Machine | MacBook Pro, Apple M1 Max, 64 GB unified memory (Metal) |
| Local engine | stable-diffusion.cpp master-647-72e512a-1-ga397e03 (sd-server, Metal) |
| Platform | Orazaka dev (DigitalOcean App Platform, Toronto) — core, relay, broker; the Mac joins through the GPU relay (chisel over TLS) |
| Hosted provider | DigitalOcean serverless inference (https://inference.do-ai.run) |
| Orazaka commit | `ffe8aed` |

Times are **command to file**: from the start of the Studio run to the finished output (queueing, transfer and storage included). The engine's own time, where it is logged, is given beside it.

## Per model

| Model | Where | Runs (ok / all) | Time, command to file (median, min–max) | Engine time | Price | Spent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Video upscaling

The same clips, taken from 720p (or 480p) to 1080p or 4K by each candidate, on one NVIDIA H100 80 GB. The verdict is a person's, after looking at the same frames side by side with a plain Lanczos upscale; the cost is the run's own time at the GPU's hourly rate.

| Model | Licence | Commercial use | Size | Time (5 s clip) | Cost per clip | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Real-ESRGAN x4plus (per frame, ffmpeg) | BSD-3-Clause | yes | 1280×704 → 1920×1080 | 104.3 s | $0.12 | sharper than Lanczos but gritty, with a painterly texture on fine detail |
| Real-ESRGAN x4plus (per frame, ffmpeg) | BSD-3-Clause | yes | 1280×704 → 3840×2160 | 127 s | $0.14 | fastest, but the 4K keeps the grain: not chosen |
| SeedVR2 3B (video diffusion) | Apache-2.0 | yes | 832×480 → 1872×1080 | 58 s | $0.06 | winner — clean detail without grain, temporally stable; 480p sources (the Orochia feed) become convincing HD |
| SeedVR2 3B (video diffusion) | Apache-2.0 | yes | 1280×720 → 1920×1080 | 107.4 s | $0.12 | winner — the default of the Studio's `upscale: 1080p` step |
| SeedVR2 3B (video diffusion) | Apache-2.0 | yes | 1280×720 → 3840×2160 | 280.3 s | $0.31 | winner — 4K holds (tiled VAE, 31 GB): `upscale: 2160p`, for a hero |
| LTX-2 19B (native high resolution) | LTX-2 Community License | conditions (free under $10M annual revenue) | — | not run | — | not run: weights larger than the pod's free disk; licence conditions to read first |

## Image-to-video bake-off

The same FLUX.2 [klein] still made at the video's own aspect through the image-generation Studio (1360×768 and 768×1360; Studio runs c3efac13-6c5b-4743-af3b-e856204f3d96 and 12cee392-9a0e-4a18-a496-44bf0d324c8a), the same motion-only prompt and negatives, the same seed. Direct diffusers runs on the pod, not Studio runs. Landscape: a cable car in the Alps at dawn (a dolly-in is asked); 9:16: a woman and a golden retriever walking in the snow (motion and anatomy). One NVIDIA H100 80 GB; the cost is the run's own time at the GPU's hourly rate. The verdict is a person's, after looking at the frame grid (first, quarter, middle, three quarters, last) of both shots.

| Model | Licence | Commercial use | Shot | Size | Time | Cost | VRAM | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wan 2.2 I2V A14B (40 steps, guidance 3.5) | Apache-2.0 | yes | 16:9 landscape | 1280×720 · 81 fr · 16 fps | 1085.8 s | $1.20 | 35.4 GB | clean and stable, but the camera barely obeys (the cabin recedes instead of the dolly-in); 18 minutes |
| Wan 2.2 I2V A14B (40 steps, guidance 3.5) | Apache-2.0 | yes | 9:16 people | 720×1280 · 81 fr · 16 fps | 1084.8 s | $1.20 | 35.4 GB | the best anatomy: a natural gait, the dog's tail, the coat; no warped limb |
| LTX-Video 0.9.8 13B distilled (8 steps) | LTX-Video Open Weights License 0.X | yes (no revenue clause) | 16:9 landscape | 1216×704 · 121 fr · 24 fps | 13.5 s | $0.01 | 38.7 GB | the winner: sharp, the dolly-in is obeyed, 80× faster than Wan |
| LTX-Video 0.9.8 13B distilled (8 steps) | LTX-Video Open Weights License 0.X | yes (no revenue clause) | 9:16 people | 704×1216 · 121 fr · 24 fps | 14.5 s | $0.02 | 38.8 GB | a good preview: natural walk, but a dark boot-sole artefact on two frames |
| CogVideoX1.5 5B I2V (50 steps) | CogVideoX License (commercial use: a free basic licence after registration, under 1M visits a month) | conditions | 16:9 landscape | 1360×768 · 81 fr · 16 fps | 406.4 s | $0.45 | 26.6 GB | clean but almost static: the requested camera move is ignored |
| CogVideoX1.5 5B I2V (50 steps) | CogVideoX License (commercial use: a free basic licence after registration, under 1M visits a month) | conditions | 9:16 people | — | not finished | — | — | not finished: 768×1360 is refused (tensor size mismatch in the pipeline) |
| HunyuanVideo 1.5 720p I2V (50 steps) | Tencent Hunyuan Community License | no for us: excludes the EU, UK and South Korea, outputs included | 16:9 landscape | — | not finished | — | — | not finished: 19 of 50 steps at 90 s a step (75 GB offloaded), about 75 minutes a clip — and the territory exclusion rules it out for a public site |
| Mochi 1 (genmo) | Apache-2.0 | yes | — | — | not finished | — | — | not run: text-to-video only |
| LongCat-Video (Meituan, 13.6B) | MIT | yes | — | — | not finished | — | — | not run: custom code outside diffusers; to try next |

**Winners:**

- **16:9 landscape and iteration**: LTX-Video 0.9.8 13B distilled — 14 s a 5 s clip at 1216×704, 39 GB, the camera move is obeyed, sharp — and commercial use is free of any revenue clause
- **9:16 people and animals**: Wan 2.2 I2V A14B at 40 steps — the best anatomy and gait; 18 minutes, so the finish of a hero clip, with LTX as the 14 s preview

## Failures, timeouts and limits

| Kind | What happened | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| access | Wan 2.2 A14B refused the first call (403) | the model access key did not list the model; an all-models key fixed it |
| limit | Wan 2.2 A14B cannot make 9:16 | every size asked (720×1280, 480×832, 1280×720, with or without aspect_ratio/resolution) came back 832×480; the model is refused for 9:16 by name rather than cropped |
| limit | Wan 2.2 TI2V 5B on the Mac (480×832, 25 frames) | MPS out of memory while decoding (26 GiB of MPS, 62 GiB held by other allocations on a 64 GB machine) |
| infrastructure | three video runs took 264 s, 439 s and 1 063 s instead of about 130 s | the Mac worker had lost its tunnel and restarted; the jobs waited in the queue (their times are left out of the statistics) |
| access | openai-gpt-image-2 refused (403) | not available for this subscription tier (tried once) |
| configuration | Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large: first Orazaka runs returned a 1×1 transparent image | the provider's base URL lacked /v1 (the client appends /images/generations): 404, then a transparent fallback; fixed with the provider do-inference-images |
| timeout | FLUX.2 [klein] returned a 1×1 placeholder on several runs (server room and notary desk on every attempt; neon arcade twice) | the image client gives up waiting through the relay (about 2 minutes) while the engine needed 60–75 s plus the transfer of a 2.5 MB image; a web deploy also restarts the relay and drops the tunnel |
| process | two FLUX.2 images (server room, notary desk) were produced in about 62 s each, then lost | later retries wrote placeholders over the same file names before they were published (a process mistake, now guarded by checking the size of each download) |
| timeout | Z-Image Turbo at 1024×1024 was dropped | the engine needs about 157 s per image (8 steps at about 18 s each), longer than the client waits |
| limit | DigitalOcean GPUs: the 48 GB sizes (L40S, RTX 6000 Ada) were never in stock; the 20 GB RTX 4000 Ada appeared and disappeared (3 starts, 2 refused for stock) | sold out in tor1, the only region the private broker's VPC reaches |
| infrastructure | ten clips in a row failed in 17 s (HTTP 500) after the first one succeeded | the worker's free-RAM pre-flight counted the first clip's resident pipeline (~22 GB) against the next job (fixed: no pre-flight for a resident pipeline, orazaka-worker-media#22) |
| infrastructure | three clips (up to 9 minutes of GPU each) were lost mid-render | every deploy of dev.orazaka.com restarts the relay: the worker's AMQP stream dropped and the process exited (fixed: the consumer reconnects and skips a redelivered job, orazaka-worker-media#24) |
| infrastructure | several runs failed with 404 on their starting photo | the platform keeps uploads on the core's disk, which a redeploy wipes; the batch runner uploads the photo again (media durable on Bunny is krizaka/orazaka#144) |
| infrastructure | the droplet's watchdog destroyed an idle droplet (1.2 h) while the laptop that drove the batch was asleep | 30 min without a job; the batch runner now resumes a run in flight from its ticket |
| limit | Wan 2.2 A14B at 720p cannot be resident on one 80 GB card | two bf16 experts are 57 GB; with the activations of 1280×720 the card is full, so the experts are offloaded to the host and swapped (~26 s a step, ~18 min a clip) |
| infrastructure | the RunPod pod kept billing about two hours after its last job | its in-pod watchdog destroys the pod through the RunPod API and the pod has no API key of its own; a guard loop on the maintainer's machine ended it (to fix: a restricted key for the pod, or stop from the driver as soon as the queue is empty) |
| configuration | the first 720p run failed: cached snapshot incomplete | the fetch pattern list had transformer/* but not the second expert transformer_2/* (fixed, orazaka-worker-media#27) |
| quality | three Wan 2.2 TI2V 5B attempts of the mint-tea pour were rejected on review | the stream missed the glass, the glass doubled, the teapot drifted — the subject was replaced rather than a bad clip shown |
| quality | Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large candidates were rejected on review (21 of the 48 images are the ones kept or compared) | a smeared glass-like haze over the face of the tea pourer, a mushy hologram; 1024×1024 is the only size the provider makes, so each kept image is cut to 16:9 |
| access | one finished clip could not be downloaded (404) and was run again | the platform keeps outputs on the core's disk, which a redeploy of dev wipes (durable media: krizaka/orazaka#144) |
| quality | the 720p text-to-video clip « City at night, neon in the rain » was rejected (a neon sign read as gibberish letters despite « no lettering »); « Acoustic guitar by the fire » replaced it | Wan 2.2 A14B draws signage on neon scenes; the text gate caught it on the frame grid |
| quality | the image-to-video clip of the snowy Plateau street drifted in colour on two seeds (grey first frame, then a saturated copper wall); its first ten frames were cut | the model re-exposes the starting image within the first 0.6 s; the rest of the clip is consistent |
| limit | LTX-2 (native high resolution) was not run | its checkpoint is 25 GB in fp8 but the repository publishes a 93 GB text encoder, more than the pod's free disk, and its licence is the LTX-2 Community License (free under $10M annual revenue, a paid agreement above) — a licence to read before it is a default |
| limit | Wan 2.2 A14B image-to-video needs its own 106 GB checkpoint | text and image are two checkpoints of the family; the network volume has 35 GB free, so it is fetched to the pod's container disk each session (2 minutes) instead of a recurring volume |
| process | the first Wan 2.2 bake-off run (18 minutes of GPU) finished but was lost | the bake script saved numpy frames as if they were PIL images (output_type); fixed (output_type=pil) and run again |
| limit | HunyuanVideo 1.5 720p image-to-video was stopped after 19 of 50 steps | 90 s a step with model offload (75 GB resident), about 75 minutes a clip; its licence also excludes the EU, UK and South Korea |

## What it cost

| Provider | Output | Price | Runs | Spent |

| A DigitalOcean GPU droplet, by the hour (through the relay) | Wan 2.2 A14B, image to video (720p, H100 80 GB) | $3.99 per GPU hour | 7 | $9.16 |
| **Total of the runs above** |  |  |  | **$42.24** |

### GPU droplet sessions (what was billed)

| Session | GPU | Hours | Rate | Billed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DigitalOcean droplet 1 (first start: image build, aborted) | RTX 4000 Ada 20 GB | 0.10 | $0.76/h | $0.08 |
| DigitalOcean droplet 2 (first clip, 18 min; failures) | RTX 4000 Ada 20 GB | 1.91 | $0.76/h | $1.45 |
| DigitalOcean droplet 3 (dropped tunnels, watchdog) | RTX 4000 Ada 20 GB | 1.05 | $0.76/h | $0.80 |
| DigitalOcean droplet 4 (idle while the driver slept) | RTX 4000 Ada 20 GB | 1.20 | $0.76/h | $0.91 |
| RunPod pod (image-to-video pairs, 10 s chains, 720p A14B heroes; it ran ~2 h past its last job because the in-pod watchdog had no key to destroy itself — the local guard loop ended it) | H100 80 GB (CA-MTL-1) | 5.01 | $3.99/h | $19.99 |
| RunPod pod (the 5B image-to-video batch of the home page, the 720p heroes, the first upscaler tests; ended by the spend guard once idle) | H100 80 GB (CA-MTL-1) | 2.50 | $3.99/h | $9.98 |
| RunPod pod (six directed image-to-video clips with Wan 2.2 A14B, one retried, the 1080p/4K passes, the Orochia hero; stopped by id when done) | H100 80 GB (CA-MTL-1) | 2.72 | $3.99/h | $10.85 |
| RunPod pod (the image-to-video bake-off: four models, two shots; a first Wan run finished but crashed in the bake script's save step and was run again) | H100 80 GB (CA-MTL-1) | 1.77 | $3.99/h | $7.06 |
| **Total billed** |  |  |  | **$51.12** |

A droplet is billed from its creation to its destruction: the sessions include the setup (image build, weights), the load of the model and the attempts that failed, which the runs above do not. The cost of a run is its own start-to-finish time at the hourly rate.

The local models cost nothing per output; the energy of the Mac was **not measured**, so none is claimed. Probes and refused calls (a 403, a size test) are not runs and are not in this table.

## Cinematic shorts

2 film(s) made by `orazaka cinema` (ADR-080, last measured **2026-10-20**): script or treatment, character references and keyframes (FLUX.2 [klein]), shots, the cut (SeedVR2 3B, speed ramps, LUT grade, titles, synthesized foley), the voice-over and the music (ACE-Step). Each film's shots, on its GPU:

- **NOVA ARDENT: DAWN OF CYAN**: Wan 2.2 I2V A14B (4-step distill) on one RunPod H100 80 GB (CA-MTL-1, $3.99/h), upscaled by SeedVR2 3B
- **The World of Krizaka: Dawn**: Wan 2.2 I2V A14B (40 steps), LTX-Video 0.9.8 13B distilled on one RunPod H200 141 GB (secure cloud, $5.29/h), upscaled by SeedVR2 3B to 2160p (batch 21)

| Film | Frame | Length | Shots (reshot) | Runs (failed) | GPU time of its runs | At the GPU rate | Wall time |

### What it cost per minute of finished film

| Measure | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Finished film | 1.72 min |
| GPU pod sessions billed (setup, reviews and reshoots included) | $58.01 |
| **Billed per minute of finished film** | **$33.81** |
| The runs' own GPU time per minute of film (what the Studio's estimate multiplies) | $21.50 |
| Wall time per minute of film (one pod, runs in sequence) | 138.3 min |

> The billed sessions also rendered the Montréal reel and the news explainer (shots, the reel's cut) that are not delivered yet, and the showcase session's own image-to-video jobs drained by the same pod: the billed figure per minute is this batch's, not a film's. A film's own cost is its runs' GPU time at the rate (the table above). « l'aube » was made outside the Studios on a GPU host running the media worker's own generator and upscaler (orazaka cinema jobs / take), 40-step Wan takes beside concurrent SeedVR2 4K upscales; its keyframes, score and narrator were made on a Mac (Metal, $0).

| Pod session | GPU | Hours | Rate | Billed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pod 1 (first start: weights and sd-server build, then released while CI ran) | H100 80 GB | 0.30 | $3.99/h | $1.20 |
| pod 2 (superhero, reel and news shots, two cuts; shared with the showcase session's I2V jobs; stopped by an idle guard at ~14:45, destroyed 15:04) | H100 80 GB | 5.22 | $3.99/h | $20.83 |
| pod 3 (resumed for the reel's music and the news shots; stopped by the coordinator for the GPU queue before a run could start: dev's runs were refused by a saturated billing pool) | H100 80 GB | 0.40 | $3.99/h | $1.60 |
| « l'aube »: H200 141 GB, secure cloud, 03:47–09:47 UTC (stopped by the spend guard at 6 h) | H200 141 GB | 6.00 | $5.29/h | $31.74 |
| « l'aube »: the same pod resumed for one reshoot and three 4K upscales, then terminated | H200 141 GB | 0.50 | $5.29/h | $2.65 |
