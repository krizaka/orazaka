/**
 * Async job lifecycle contract: <b>start a run</b> → the job it dispatched → retrieve.
 *
 * <p>This suite used to POST {@code /api/v1/jobs} with a feature key and an empty payload. That
 * endpoint is gone (ADR-068 §5): a job is produced by a <b>run</b> now, and there is no other way
 * to make one. So the flow starts where a user starts — the composer's button row — and then
 * asserts the same three things about the job that run dispatched: it exists, it is retrievable by
 * id, and something consumes it.
 *
 * <p>Which Studio is used is read off {@code /api/v1/studios/composer} rather than named here: the
 * row is what this deployment can launch from one input, and a suite that hardcoded a key would
 * fail for the wrong reason the day a pack changed.
 *
 * <p>{@link Isolated} because the {@code @AfterAll} purge deletes EVERY job of the shared admin
 * account: run concurrently, it erases jobs sibling ITs (e.g. AmqpContractIT) just submitted,
 * making their consumers fail with "Job does not exist" mid-flight.
