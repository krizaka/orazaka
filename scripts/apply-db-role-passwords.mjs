/**
 * Gives every per-context database role the password its service is configured with.
 *
 * **Why an empty volume needs this, and why nobody had noticed.** `infra/initdb/*.sql` creates each
 * context's role with `LOGIN` and **no password**: psql 15 cannot read the environment (`\getenv`
 * arrived in 16), ERR-125 bans a shell script in the initdb directory, and a committed literal is
 * the defect that was closed in audit #5. The seeds say so in their own comments — the password is
 * applied afterwards, from `<CONTEXT>_DB_PASSWORD`, by `orazaka start`.
 *
 * The e2e harness does not run `orazaka start`; it runs `docker compose up` itself. On a volume
 * that survived from some earlier `orazaka start` the roles already had passwords, so this step was
 * invisible — **which is exactly what "not hermetic" was hiding**. The first run from a genuinely
 * empty volume ends with:
 *
 *   [krizaka-users-service] FATAL: password authentication failed for user "orazaka_identity"
 *
 * and the stack does not come up. So "the harness reaches a working stack from empty" was not true,
 * and no scripted path made it true. This is that path. It is deliberately **not** a migration
 * framework: this is one `ALTER ROLE` per context, which is what the seeds already document.
 *
 * **The contexts are derived from the seed, not listed.** Every `CREATE ROLE orazaka_<ctx> LOGIN`
 * in `infra/initdb/` contributes one, so a seventh bounded context is covered by the file that
 * creates it. The CLI's own copy of this step carries a hardcoded five-element list and will not
 * be; that divergence is recorded rather than repaired here.
 *
 * Fails closed: a role whose password is missing from the environment is reported and the script
 * exits non-zero, because a stack that cannot authenticate is not a stack the gate should test.
