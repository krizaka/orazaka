/**
 * Refuses to test a stack that is not this build.
 *
 * Why. The e2e harness does not tear down when the build fails before `post-integration-test`, so a
 * failed run leaves its JVMs listening. Twenty-one minutes were once lost to an `/actuator/health`
 * answered by the previous run's conversation service — but the wasted time is the visible half.
 * **The other half is that a stale stack answers on the right port with the wrong code**, so a green
 * can come from yesterday's build and nothing in the harness could tell the difference. Teardown
 * prevents the waste; this prevents the wrong answer, and only the first had been noticed.
 *
 * How. `spring-boot-maven-plugin:build-info` stamps `build.time` into every service's
 * `META-INF/build-info.properties` at package time, and the service reports it at `/actuator/info`.
 * This compares what each service SAYS against what is on disk for the module the harness started.
 * A process from an earlier build reports an earlier time and is refused by name.
 *
 * It runs in the health gate rather than inside a test runner, because everything in
 * `integration-test` — the Java ITs as well as the HTTP contracts — must be protected, and the
 * first of those to run would otherwise have already talked to the stale process.
 *
 * Usage: verify-stack-identity.mjs <moduleDir>=<baseUrl> ...
