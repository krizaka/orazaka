/**
 * Runs the tier-1 HTTP contracts and asserts that every assertion they DECLARE was REPORTED.
 *
 * Why this wrapper exists. httpyac's assert grammar is `?? [js] <selector> <operator> [value]` with
 * the operator last, and an expression it cannot parse does not always fail — one that opens with
 * `[` produces **no tick, no cross, and no error**: the line simply is not in the output. Measured,
 * not guessed (ADR-069 §0.3). So any assertion in this suite may silently not be running, and the
 * suite's own exit code cannot tell you.
 *
 * This is the third application of one property, not a new idea:
 *
 *   Java   — GOV-006 fails a governance rule that completes having examined zero subjects.
 *   Python — test_main.py fails when the tests a file defines differ from the tests the runner
 *            collected, and names the ones never collected.
 *   Here   — a green run must have reported every assertion the sources declare.
 *
 * It also reports the honest request count. httpyac prints "N requests processed" where N is the
 * number of `###` REGIONS, and this suite uses `###` for banner rules and prose as well as for
 * request delimiters — so the number everybody quoted as proof counts decorative lines as passing
 * requests, and cannot go down when a request is deleted. Both numbers are printed from here on.
 *
 * The count is enforced only when httpyac itself succeeded. A failing run has already stopped at
 * `--bail`, and the assertions after the failure legitimately did not run; adding a second,
 * derived failure on top of the real one would bury it.
